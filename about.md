Hello,

This is me. I'm **Mohamed Zaatar**. A software consultant in Perth, Australia.
I work for [Readify](http://readify.net) as Software Developer/Consultant.

# Technical Profile

I have 9+ years in software development and implementation with many success stories.
I hold a bachelor and masters degrees in Computer Sciences.

My expertise is almost around Microsoft Stack but I have knowledge and some experience in Other worlds as well. I'm a Microsoft Certified Application Developer `MCAD` and Sun Certified Java Programmer `SCJP` since 2006.

In 2015, I recertified myself against new Microsoft stack and became MCP for `Programming in HTML5 with JavaScript and CSS3` and `Developing ASP.NET MVC Web Applications`.

And I'm proudly a `Professional Scrum Master`. 


# Personal Profile

I'm a husband for a beautiful wife Riham, a brother for an amazing dentist Hesham, and a friend.
